## Overview
The current OLabs platform lacks AI-driven mathematical problem-solving, making it difficult for students to get instant solutions. There is no real-time equation recognition or automated system to solve handwritten math problems. Additionally, students cannot extract transcripts from educational videos and procedures to receive AI-generated answers, making it harder to understand complex equations step by step.

## Features

### CANVAS AI
The mathematics-focused canvas allows users to write equations and draw diagrams, enabling AI to recognize and solve them in real-time. It provides instant, step-by-step solutions, making complex problem-solving easier and more interactive for students.

### VIDEO TRANSCRIBER
The video transcriber converts audio from videos into text using the OpenAI Whisper model. This enables accurate transcription, allowing students to access and search educational content more effectively.

### RAG CHATBOT
The RAG-based chatbot processes the transcripts to provide accurate answers. It enables students to ask questions related to the video and receive context-aware responses, enhancing their learning experience.

## How It Enhances OLabs
- Adds AI-powered problem-solving to OLabs.
- Improves mathematics learning through real-time equation solving.
- Helps students understand complex equations step-by-step.
- Makes educational videos more interactive with video transcript-based Q&A.
- Boosts engagement & accessibility for students using OLabs.

## Innovation
- AI-powered equation recognition for handwritten/math input.
- Multilingual support for transcripts & chatbot responses.
- Works on any device (web & mobile) for flexible learning.
